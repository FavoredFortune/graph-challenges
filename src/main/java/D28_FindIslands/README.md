# Overview
Create a method that brings in an adjacency matrix and returns number of islands present in the graph data structure.
## Challenge
Using no built in methods determine if a graph has any "islands" (unconnected nodes) or not.

## Solution
In this challenge, I white boarded on my tablet and then coded in the IDE.

I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

#DOCUMENTATION
##Code Challenge
Determine the number of Islands of connected nodes

##Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called find_islands
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named FindIslands() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a file called find_islands.js
Python: a file called find_islands.py
Java: a file called FindIslands.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.

##Feature Tasks
Create a function that brings an an adjacency matrix and determines whether or not there are any islands. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the number of islands present in the graph data structure.

##Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
