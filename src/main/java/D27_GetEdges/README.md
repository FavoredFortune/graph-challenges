# Overview

Create a method with a helper method to determine if business trips are possible and what their costs are. 
## Challenge
Using no built in methods determine with one function if a trip is possible and with another function (when trip is 
possible) determine and return cost.


## Solution
In this challenge, I white boarded on my tablet and then coded in the IDE.

I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

#DOCUMENTATION
##Code Challenge
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called get-edges
On your branch, createâ€¦
C#: Create a method named GetEdge outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a file called get_edge.js
Python: a file called get_edges.py
Java: a file called GetEdge.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.

##Feature Tasks
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

##Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
