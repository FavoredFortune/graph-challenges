# Overview

Create a method that returns a breadth-first traversal list of nodes from a graph.

## Challenge
Build a new method that tracks each node visited, visiting each node just once and return a list of nodes visited in 
breadth-first traverssal order.


## Solution
In this challenge, I white boarded on my tablet and then coded in the IDE.

I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

#DOCUMENTATION

#Code Challenge
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

##Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. 
Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment

Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called breadth-first-graph
On your branch, create… - C#: Create a method named BreadthFirst() inside of your Graph class. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a file called breadth_first.js
Python: a file called breadth_first.py
Java: a file called BreadthFirst.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.

NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.


##Feature Tasks
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

##Example
###Graph
![example graph](/Users/sooz/codefellows/401Java/graph-challenges/assets/graph26.png)

##Output:
`Pandora, Arendelle, Metroville, Monstroplolis, Narnia, Naboo`


##Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, define a new method that accepts two nodes as input and uses your traversal algorithm to determine if a path exists between the two nodes.

##Submission Instructions
